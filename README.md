# Separability_metric: A data quality screening framework

This repo contains the public code from our paper (accepted by Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing).  
It provides:
- Implementations of Tao components (local/topological-style features + global divergence).
- Baseline unsupervised cluster indices (Dunn, Silhouette, Daviesâ€“Bouldin) with normalized mapping.
- Reproducible experiments on **SECOM** (binary) and **SPF** (multi-class) benchmarks.

> **Note:** Proprietary datasets (Cevher, Nissan, Cold Roll) and any code that can reveal private data are **not** included.
